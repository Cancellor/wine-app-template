This is a KISS sandbox for simple Wine applications.

1. Put this directory anywhere you like
2. Run "./winecfg" and do some basic configuration (or just press OK)
3. Install your application somehow like this:
   $ env WINEPREFIX="/path/to/this/directory" wine /path/to/setup.exe
   or just unpack it into "./wine/drive_c/Program Files/<Name>".
4. Edit "./desktop" (Required: Name, Categories;
                     Optional: GenericName, Comment, MimeType)
5. Edit "./start"   (Required: exec wine ...)
6. Optional: replace "./icon" with the real icon
7. Run "./update"

REMEMBER: You have to run "./update" every time you move
          or rename this directory.

Enjoy!
