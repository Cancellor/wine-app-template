This is a KISS sandbox for simple Wine applications.

1. Put this directory anywhere you like
2. Run "./winecfg" and do some basic configuration (or just press OK)
3. Run "./install" to select a "setup.exe" from the "Open.." dialog
   (this requires zenity; if you don't have it, installer's path can also
   be passed via command line), or just unpack your app into
   "./wine/drive_c/Program Files/<Name>" if it comes without installer.
4. Edit "./desktop" (Required: Name, Categories;
                     Optional: GenericName, Comment, MimeType)
5. Edit "./start"   (Required: exec wine "C:\Program FIles\<blablabla>")
6. Optional: replace "./icon" with the real icon
7. Run "./update"

REMEMBER: You have to run "./update" every time you move
          or rename this directory.

Enjoy!
